Ridgway</a></p> </blockquote> <h1>Tracking Things</h1> <p>I like measuring things and keeping track of data points. In a way, you could say I resonated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">Quantified self</a> movement.</p> <p>I really jumped into it when I received my own laptop at University and discovered <a href="https://whatpulse.org/">WhatPulse</a>, an application to track keyboard/mouse usage. Growing up I played a lot of video games where character progression is always about making numbers go up. With that in mind, it&rsquo;s easy to see why I would gravitate towards something like WhatPulse.</p> <h1>So Much Data!</h1> <p>Over the years I added more things that I decided to <em>tracked</em>:</p> <ul> <li>Productivity on the Computer via <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/31263">RescueTime (Referral Link)</a></li> <li>Steps, Heart Rate, Sleep, etc.. via a <a href="https://www.fitbit.com">Fitbit</a> then eventually <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a></li> <li>Fluid intake via <a href="https://waterminder.com/">WaterMinder</a></li> <li>Food intake via <a href="https://www.loseit.com/">Lose It!</a></li> <li>GPS location via <a href="https://www.bigpaua.com/arcapp/">Arc</a> (iOS only)</li> </ul> <p><strong>So even with all this data, what do I do with it? Well, not much&hellip;</strong></p> <p>To further illustrate this, I&rsquo;ll break down what I track, the reason I started, and its usage right now.</p> <ul> <li>Fluid Data <ul> <li>Reason: Wanted to know if I was drinking enough.</li> <li>Usage: My average has been pretty steady for the last year. I pretty much always have the same drinks each day as I work from home.</li> </ul></li> <li>Food Data <ul> <li>Reason: Wanted to know my calorie and weight and how they change</li> <li>Usage: I&rsquo;ve basically been the same weight (plus/minus 10 pounds) for all my adult life.</li> </ul></li> <li>GPS Data <ul> <li>Reason: The app seemed super cool! I could keep track of where I&rsquo;ve been.</li> <li>Usage: I just keep collecting data, granted with COVID and moving to work from home there is less travel.</li> </ul></li> <li>Productivity Data <ul> <li>Reason: Wanted to improve my productivity when I&rsquo;m on my computer.</li> <li>Usage: It <em>nudges</em> me with reminders on how much time I spend on my computer in various applications/activities. Granted&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think it is helping that much.</li> </ul></li> <li>Step, Heart Rate, Sleep Data <ul> <li>Reason: Good health indicators I wanted to keep track of. It also comes for free with the Apple Watch.</li> <li>Usage: I look at these quite often as it&rsquo;s always on my wrist and phone via Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem and their Health data.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>As we can see, not a lot of usage coming from the data. Most things are consistent, habitual, not a problem, or not providing any tangible value.</p> <h1>Existential Crisis</h1> <p>There have been a few moments that made me question <strong><em>&ldquo;why am I doing this?&rdquo;</em></strong>, and ultimately should I stop tracking something? Moments like data loss (i.e., I had lost several years of GPS data by accident), or moving to different platforms (Fitbit to Apple Watch). It&rsquo;s been hard to stop collecting as I see it as a data trove in a hoarding sense.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve recently come to terms that the act of <em>measuring</em> is in a way causing me some anxiety and inconvenience. The following are just two examples:</p> <ul> <li>I must ensure Arc is running to capture GPS data points before leaving the house.</li> <li>I keep mental notes at times to backfill foods/drinks.</li> </ul> <p>Ultimately, it boils down to the mental burden of tracking and ensuring things are being captured correctly.</p> <p>Not everything is free in measuring data. Either you are paying for a service/storage/tools, the time, the cognitive burden (with manual tracking), or even resources on a device (i.e., running the GPS on a phone).</p> <p>The <em>final straw which broke the camel&rsquo;s back</em> is that Arc no longer has a free tier, and is now a subscription (or a hefty lifetime purchase).</p> <p>So&hellip; this goes back to <em>&ldquo;Why am I doing this?&rdquo;</em></p> <h2>The Power of Correlations and Trends</h2> <p>The counter-argument to keep tracking is to identify correlations and deviations in the data. This is the goal of the Quantified Self, and I would say the ultimate benefit; to identify when things might be slipping and need a course correction.</p> <p>Being able to synthesize all the data and pull out trends and correlations (like <a href="https://exist.io/">Exist</a> does &ndash; but costs a subscription) looks powerful. But I&rsquo;ll be honest, I never gave understanding correlations a solid shot. I was always thinking of trying to build my own tool (but yeah&hellip; that never happened).</p> <p>The critical measurements around health are <em>pretty</em> easy to identify though as you can typically <em>see/feel</em> the changes (even if they are happening slowly).</p> <p>As it stands, where I am in my life right now, the extra effort in measuring, curating, and consuming <em>all</em> the data is not worth the small short- or medium-term gains for me.</p> <h1>Moving Forward</h1> <p>All in all, this isn&rsquo;t to say I&rsquo;m abandoning all my data collection. I&rsquo;m just going to be more selective, and intentional by thinking about the following:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Prefer passive measurements with no/low data loss issues.</strong></li> <li><strong>Measure what I want to manage.</strong></li> <li><strong>Re-evaluate periodically what I&rsquo;m measuring and ask if it is still useful.</strong></li> </ol> <p>I can now simplify what I collect right now and boil it down to the following:</p> <ul> <li>Health metrics via Apple Watch</li> <li>Computer productivity via ResuceTime</li> </ul> <p>Both of these require no effort on my part as these are <em>always</em> collected without any manual intervention.</p> <p>This means I can free myself of Lose It! (Food), WaterMinder (Fluid), and Arc (GPS). These all took a toll on me for <em>no reason</em> as I wasn&rsquo;t currently benefiting from their results. I was measuring stuff I didn&rsquo;t really care about or didn&rsquo;t need to care about anymore. Initially, measuring these things played their part, but it is time to move forward.</p> <p>If I need to manage something and I can measure it, you can bet I will at least for the short-term.</p> <div class=article__comments-button><button type=button class="btn btn-default show-comments">Click to Disqus</button></div> <div id=disqus_thread></div> </div> </div> </div> <script>
