Since then, I have consistently produced a blog post every month. There are a couple of reasons why I blog and why I wanted to keep the monthly cadence:</p> <ul> <li>Sharing Knowledge</li> <li>Improving my Writing</li> <li>Online Presence</li> <li>Recognition</li> </ul> <p>Over the last five years, I&rsquo;ve:</p> <ul> <li>Published 63 blog posts.</li> <li>Wrote 53,017 words (includes a bit of markup here and there).</li> <li>Created content that would take 263 minutes to read (assuming 180 words per minute).</li> <li>Reached 78,121 people with my writing.</li> </ul> <p>In this post, I want to reflect on this journey &ndash; goals, challenges, rewards.</p> <h1>Challenges with Blogging</h1> <h2>Time Commitment</h2> <p>This is my biggest struggle with blogging. I procrastinate until the last possible moment and usually post within the last few days of the month.</p> <p>The time commitment for each blog post varies depending on its content. The technical ones normally require a lot of upfront work (building the project and writing the code), while the non-technical posts are typically shorter to write.</p> <p>Overall, I try to work on the posts in the evenings, but it sometimes bleeds into the weekend. Having a family makes it a bit challenging, but not impossible as my wife is a rockstar. A post can be <em>chipped away</em> at instead of just writing the whole thing in one go, which is something I want to do more consistently.</p> <h2>Blogging Platform</h2> <p>I built my blog using <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. If you&rsquo;re interested, you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/kevinjalbert/kevinjalbert.github.io">GitHub repository for the website</a>.</p> <p>Early on, I put a decent amount of work into making the site. It still serves its purpose but isn&rsquo;t aging well. I almost always hit some local development issue when I spin it up as the technology stack/dependencies are old.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m torn &ndash; I want a simple platform for writing, but I want customization capabilities. I&rsquo;ll likely move to a new platform in the future, but it&rsquo;s such a daunting task. I&rsquo;ll also plan to investigate using an off-the-shelf solution for blogging. The idea is to spend less time on the platform and more time on creating content.</p> <h2>Driving Traffic</h2> <p>Getting traffic to my website is something I don&rsquo;t really enjoy, and for the most part, I really depend on organic traffic and just the general SEO (Search Engine Optimization) that my website provides.</p> <p>At one point, I decided to add a newsletter (which has just surpassed 100 subscribers). I&rsquo;m currently using <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> as it has an option to consume an RSS feed that pushes emails out to subscribers.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve also done some posting here and there on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>. When the subreddit matches the blog post topic it can drive some traffic. I saw this best when I was writing Notion related posts.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve cross-posted a few times on <a href="https://dev.to/kevinjalbert">Dev.to</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@kevinjalbert">Medium</a>, but haven&rsquo;t done so in a while. I&rsquo;m still not 100% sure about the measurable benefits of cross-posting and whether it&rsquo;s worth the time.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve occasionally promoted my posts on social media. Similar to the above point, do the benefits outweigh the time invested. I have seen some traction when tagging companies or topics to widen the reach.</p> <h1>Rewards of Blogging</h1> <h2>Reaching Many</h2> <p>The following image is a snapshot of the five years in Google Analytics. I take pride that so many people have seen my content. The growth is a nice nod as well in keeping the monthly cadence up.</p> <p><img alt="Blog stats" width=1912 height=1318 src="/images/2021-01-30-reflecting-on-five-years-of-monthly-blogging/blog-stats.png"/></p> <h2>Following Referrals</h2> <p>It is nice to see <em>where</em> my content is reaching, and the following image shows how users are finding my content from a referral perspective. When drilling into specifics, it&rsquo;s rewarding to see one of my blog posts ending up in a <a href="https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/pull/1134#issue-466028793">GitHub issue</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7298088/def-block-in-rake-task">StackOverflow answer</a>, or <a href="https://tshaped.io/zapier-and-notion/">blog post</a>.</p> <p><img alt="Blog referrals" width=1958 height=1728 src="/images/2021-01-30-reflecting-on-five-years-of-monthly-blogging/blog-referrals.png"/></p> <h2>Ability to Refer to own Posts</h2> <p>At times during my work, I am able to refer a colleague to a post of my own. I&rsquo;ve had colleagues mention that they had found my posts when searching for a topic as well. I&rsquo;ve even caught myself stumbling upon my own post when Googling.</p> <p>By writing down some information as a post, I don&rsquo;t have to reiterate it again if it is relevant &ndash; I can simply link to it.</p> <h1>The Future</h1> <p>I see myself continuing with my monthly blog post for the foreseeable future. It&rsquo;s worth my time investment.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve recently made posts that have a YouTube video embedded in them. Normally these are for demos from a side project. I&rsquo;ll likely continue these tactics, and experiment how I can incorporate them into a variety of other post topics. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFWPd8rky_tD4B4Qqq99i4Q">My YouTube channel</a> is very much in its infancy, and the quality of the videos could use some improvement.</p> <p><img alt="Youtube stats" width=1384 height=874 src="/images/2021-01-30-reflecting-on-five-years-of-monthly-blogging/youtube-stats.png"/></p> <p>As mentioned in the challenges section, I have dabbled in other services and platforms to broadcast my content. I would like to further explore this as it has the potential to drive more traffic to my content and improve the SEO.</p> <p>My current blogging set up is aging, and I would really like to improve it. I plan to look into using a more modern <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>.</p> <p>Thank you for reading my content over the past five years. I look forward to creating new content that sparks interest.</p> <div class=article__comments-button><button type=button class="btn btn-default show-comments">Click to Disqus</button></div> <div id=disqus_thread></div> </div> </div> </div> <script>
