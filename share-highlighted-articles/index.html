I&rsquo;ve recently made another change to my day-to-day workflow that accommodates sharing knowledge &ndash; highlighting articles.</p> <h1>Information Recollection</h1> <p>In the software development world, I&rsquo;m consuming a decent amount of articles from various sources. This is in a way how I keep up with the new changes in the landscape, which in its self could be an interesting short article on its own. I heavily use <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> to stash articles I find throughout the day and I then slowly consume them at my own leisure. I had it such that if I <em>favourite</em> an article in Pocket then, through <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a> it will be saved in <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a>. Evernote is my go-to note-taking and information recollection solution.</p> <p>This approach works well, although I want to <em>distil</em> and <em>reinforce</em> the materials I&rsquo;m consuming. My hypothesis is that I&rsquo;ll have more succinct notes within Evernote and thus able to take advantage of more narrow focus search efforts. I have settled on using a highlighting service to accomplish for marking important passages that end up being searchable in Evernote.</p> <h1>Highlighting Services</h1> <p>I reviewed four highlighting services to find the best one that fits my needs. I quickly passed over <a href="https://diigo.com">Diigo</a> and <a href="https://www.lumioapp.com">Lumio</a>, as they just didn&rsquo;t appeal to me. These next two were my serious contenders that I evaluated.</p> <h2><a href="https://getliner.com">Liner</a></h2> <p>Liner is a solid option for highlighting. The chrome extension works very well and is boiled down to the fundamentals: highlighting and comments. It offers a Pocket integration, which is nice, although not really needed. The ability to export highlights to Evernote is excellent, and as an off the shelf solution does what I need. The iOS application also is well done and works as expected. The sharing feature provides a link which renders the full article with highlightings in it, simple and effective &ndash; <a href="http://lnr.li/PbYky">example Liner shared link</a>.</p> <p>Even though there is a subscription at $5/month or $50/year, it is not really necessary. You get folder support along with, more colours and advance search. The colours I couldn&rsquo;t really care for, and the search will be covered by Evernote. Folders are also unimportant to me. Overall this means I don&rsquo;t have to pay for this service.</p> <p>I really like Liner, and it almost made my pick. It satisfies all my needs, although it became my second choice as the next service Highly has a very neat <em>social</em> feature.</p> <h2><a href="https://www.highly.co">Highly</a></h2> <p>Highly is very similar to Liner in terms of highlighting. It is, even more, streamline as it only offers highlights and drops comments. The main benefit I noticed with Highly is the <a href="https://medium.com/highlight-to-share/the-highlight-layer-45b9a8e86476">Highlight Layer</a>, which when you browse articles provides a social aspect to highlighting. This is pretty awesome as I can see a summary of new articles assuming someone has marked it up before me. In addition, the interface of the extension I would argue is slightly better than Liner. Highly also offers a Pocket integration like Liner. The iOS application for highlighting is also quite nice and offers a great user experience.</p> <p><img alt="Highlight Layer" width=427 height=194 src="/images/2017-10-31-share-highlighted-articles/highlight-layer.jpg"/></p> <p>I was pleasantly surprised with the highlighting experience, considering I didn&rsquo;t think you could improve much with highlighting. As you&rsquo;ll see, the highlighting will automatically expand to fill the words in case you didn&rsquo;t select them from the beginning or end:</p> <p><img alt="Smart Highlighting by Highly" width=577 height=147 src="/images/2017-10-31-share-highlighted-articles/highly-smart-highlighting.gif"/></p> <p>In contrast to how Liner displays the whole page with highlights when you share a link, Highly provides a summary page &ndash; <a href="https://www.highly.co/hl/FJrJO5TzhZt7d3">example Highly shared link</a>. You can always drop into the context of the whole page, but this only works if you have the extension installed otherwise you get a prompt to install it.</p> <p>Highly does offer a subscription as well for $2/month or $20/year, but all you get is private highlights. To me, that doesn&rsquo;t matter since I want everything to be public, and out in the open for others to benefit from.</p> <p>The Evernote storage is non-existent in Highly&hellip; although I did counter this with a hacked together Zapier integration. That I&rsquo;ll cover in the next section.</p> <p>Highly&rsquo;s excellent highlighting experience along with the social aspect sold me on it. Liner is a great contender and I am going to keep my eyes on it to see what they come up with in the future. Even though Highly didn&rsquo;t offer an Evernote solution, I was able to hack a more favourable one using Zapier.</p> <h1>Evernote Notes with Highly and Zapier</h1> <p>As mentioned I want Evernote integration with the highlighting service I use, and with Highly it wasn&rsquo;t there. I was pleased with the rest of Highly that I was willing to make it work.</p> <p>First thing I was looking at was the RSS feed that Highly provides, figuring I could tie this with Zapier. Turns out that there already existed a <a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/iTCzjXUP-highly-highlights-in-evernote">Highly highlights in Evernote on IFTTT</a> already. The main issue is that the RSS feed has one item for each highlight. So you cannot aggregate all the highlights for a completed articled into one note. This wasn&rsquo;t going to do it for me.</p> <p>You can email a Highly link, so I was going to just email them into Evernote. While this worked, there were a couple of issues:</p> <ol> <li>Evernote&rsquo;s free account only allows 5 emails per month. I was not a paying customer and wasn&rsquo;t planning on taking the additional cost at the moment.</li> <li>The email is heavily branded with Highly, as it is meant to be a link sent to someone other than yourself.</li> <li>The title of the email was generic and uninformative &ndash; <em>kevinjalbert sent you a highlight.</em></li> </ol> <p><img alt="Highly Share Email To Evernote" width=425 height=745 src="/images/2017-10-31-share-highlighted-articles/email-to-evernote.jpg"/></p> <p>Fortunately, with Zapier, you can chain multiple actions together (limit of 3 with a free account). Zapier allows for some powerful workflows, especially since you can use JavaScript or Python to manipulate data within the flow.</p> <p><img alt="Zapier Highly To Evernote Flow" width=380 height=495 src="/images/2017-10-31-share-highlighted-articles/zapier-highly-flow.jpg"/></p> <p>I use a Zapier inbound email trigger, that triggers when I email the share link from Highly. I then feed the HTML formatted email into a JavaScript function where I can clean up the <code>inputData.rawBody</code> and <code>inputData.htmlBody</code> and return an object for the next step.</p> <div class=highlight><pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">titleRegex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sr">/kevinjalbert's highlights</span><span class="se">\s</span><span class="sr">+</span><span class="se">(</span><span class="sr">.*</span><span class="se">)</span><span class="sr">/g</span><span class="p">;</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>Cleaning up the HTML body was an interesting task to make it conform to Evernote&rsquo;s <a href="https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/enml.php">ENML</a> format. The code is a hack and brittle, but it works. I also extract the title so that I can ensure that the note&rsquo;s title is properly reflecting in Evernote. The final step is to put all this together into the Evernote action template.</p> <p><img alt="Zapier Create Evernote Note Template" width=760 height=560 src="/images/2017-10-31-share-highlighted-articles/zapier-create-evernote-note.jpg"/></p> <p>With the Zapier flow, I now get a succinct note with the highlightings for an article. It triggers instantly when I send the email from Highly.</p> <p><img alt="Zapier Formatted Email To Evernote" width=425 height=500 src="/images/2017-10-31-share-highlighted-articles/zapier-formatted-to-evernote.jpg"/></p> <h1>Highlighting Workflow</h1> <p>Now armed with my highlighter I can mark the good parts that I feel are most important when consuming articles online. With the ability to share summary links, I can better ensure that the take aways from the article surfaces easier. Finally, with my Evernote Zapier integration, I know that my highlighted information is always a few keystrokes away.</p> <p>My goal is to highlight every article that lands in my Pocket. With Highly&rsquo;s social aspects I hope that my highlights help future readers. In a similar fashion, I am always pleased when I see that someone else has already highlighted an article for the key points.</p> <p>Make sure to check out my highlights and <a href="https://www.highly.co/by/kevinjalbert">follow me on Highly</a></p> <div class=newsletter__form> <div class="panel panel-default"> <div class=panel-heading> <h4 class="panel-title accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle=collapse data-parent="#accordion" href="#newsletterFormCollapse"> Signup for my Newsletter </h4> </div> <div id=newsletterFormCollapse class="panel-collapse collapse"> <div class=panel-body> <link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/horizontal-slim-10_7.css" rel=stylesheet> <style>
