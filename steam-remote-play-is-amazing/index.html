This post can be seen more as an informative tip for gamers who use <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>, which they might not know about.</p> <h2>Steam Remote Play</h2> <p>If you do any form of PC gaming, you likely know about Steam. It&rsquo;s a great service that has been around for a while. Fun fact &ndash; I found out that my Steam account is 17 years old! Steam has a wide selection of games, and over the years many new features have been added. I want to talk about one such feature &ndash; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay">Steam Remote Play</a>.</p> <p>Steam Remote Play blew my mind when I first tried it out. It lets you stream a game from a system running Steam to a compatible client (e.g., an iPhone/iPad, Apple TV, etc.). The inputs and outputs work seamlessly and you are able to fully experience the game without being confined to where your gaming PC is located.</p> <p>I personally use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-link/id1246969117">Steam Link</a> app on my iPhone and Apple TV. Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem can use Bluetooth controllers (e.g., Xbox Controller) as an input, so this allows me to play games from a comfy couch like a console gamer. For those times that I need a keyboard or mouse, Steam Remote Play can also stream to another Steam Desktop client on my MacBook.</p> <h2>Tips</h2> <p>The following are a couple of tips that I&rsquo;ve found useful during my time using Steam Remote Play.</p> <h3>Wired Network Connection</h3> <p>The best thing you can do to improve your experience with Steam Remote Play is a strong LAN connection between the gaming PC and the clients you want to play on. A bad network connection increases input lag and graphical artifacts (pixelated look). It took a bit of work, but I was able to get a direct-wired ethernet connection from my router between my Apple TV and my gaming PC. The connection is such that I can&rsquo;t tell whether I&rsquo;m streaming or playing locally.</p> <h3>Wake-on-LAN</h3> <p>I didn&rsquo;t want to keep my gaming PC on all the time from a power consumption perspective. I only use it when I want to play games, however, it resides in another room different from where I&rsquo;m playing.</p> <p>I take advantage of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/wake-on-lan-feature"><em>Wake-on-LAN</em></a> in Windows. This allows the Steam Link app to send a <em>wake-up</em> packet when it tries to connect to the gaming PC, which powers on the PC for me on-demand. The finishing touch here is that I set a 10 minute <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-adjust-power-and-sleep-settings-in-windows-26f623b5-4fcc-4194-863d-b824e5ea7679">sleep timer in Windows</a>, which makes it so when you exit a game and stop streaming the PC will go to sleep.</p> <h3>Non-Steam Games</h3> <p>I also found out you can add <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4B8B-9697-2338-40EC">Non-Steam games</a>, which still work via Steam Remote Play. This opens up a lot of opportunities as Steam is essentially opening/closing an executable. You could have games from another store (e.g., <a href="https://www.[epicgames.com/store">Epic Games</a>), stand-alone games, or even ROMs if you are into that (via <a href="https://steamgriddb.github.io/steam-rom-manager/">Steam ROM Manager</a>).</p> <h3>Dedicated Controller</h3> <p>The whole point of this setup is to increase comfort when playing games by not being tied to a desk (assuming the game can be played with a controller). Having a dedicated controller just lowers the friction of <em>getting into a game</em>. With my Apple TV setup, I just turn the Xbox Controller and Apple TV on, start up Steam Link and I&rsquo;m playing within a minute or less.</p> <div class=article__comments-button><button type=button class="btn btn-default show-comments">Click to Disqus</button></div> <div id=disqus_thread></div> </div> </div> </div> <script>
