No matter the safeguards you&rsquo;ve put in place, there is always the expected scenarios. There are many ways to prepare and to ensure that your services are as robust as possible, but that is a task left to you the reader. In this post I&rsquo;ll be talking about what to do <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve handled a production disruption.</p> <h1>Why Track?</h1> <p>A disruption can be a chaotic event, lasting from a few minutes to multiple hours. The main purpose of tracking these disruptions is to have a better understanding of:</p> <ul> <li>what led to the issue.</li> <li>what could have been done to prevent the issue from happening?</li> <li>flaws in monitoring in detecting when the issue started.</li> <li>learnings and processes when dealing with a similar issue in the future.</li> </ul> <p>I highly encourage disseminating the learnings around all aspects of a disruption to the rest of the team and organization. A tracked disruption can be used in a post-mortem. The ultimate goal is by educating everyone it will lead to more resilient services and better processes during the inevitable future disruptions.</p> <p>In addition, with tracked disruptions, it becomes easy to perform basic analysis of the frequency and length of disruptions.</p> <p>Without any tracking, it becomes a huge failure if the same disruption happens again over and over.</p> <h1>Tracking</h1> <p>One thing to note is that the following is from experience that I have working at <a href="http://company.thescore.com/">theScore</a>, along with reading various sources online. Let us touch on what to track, where to track, and how to track.</p> <h2>What to Track?</h2> <p>The more information you have the better you&rsquo;ll understand the disruption if you weren&rsquo;t immediately involved in it. Additionally, in most cases, multiple people are involved and so not everyone had the same exposure to the entire event. The following is a list and description of what we track at theScore for disruptions.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Service(s)</strong>: name of service(s) that were interrupted.</li> <li><strong>Disruption Meta-Information</strong>: at-a-glance information about the disruption. <ul> <li><strong>Type</strong>: what type of disruption (i.e., Infrastructure, Critical Bug, Data Provider, etc&hellip;).</li> <li><strong>Start Time</strong>: when the disruption started (not necessarily when it was discovered).</li> <li><strong>Detection Time</strong>: when the disruption was detected by users/support/team.</li> <li><strong>End Time</strong>: when the disruption was resolved (action items may extend past this time).</li> <li><strong>Length</strong>: the total time the disruption was active (based on start/end times).</li> <li><strong>Time to Detection</strong>: time to detect the disruption (based on start/detection times).</li> <li><strong>People Involved</strong>: list of individuals involved in handling the disruption.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Summary</strong>: a high-level summary of the disruption (root cause and impact).</li> <li><strong>Timeline</strong>: a table of events which constructs the timeline of the disruption. <ul> <li><strong>Timestamp</strong>: approximate time of this event.</li> <li><strong>Party Involved</strong>: who/what was involved with this event (i.e., servers, people, services).</li> <li><strong>Description</strong>: what happened at this event.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Retrospective</strong>: a reflection of the disruption used for learnings. <ul> <li><strong>Good</strong>: what went well (i.e., process, safeguards, etc&hellip;).</li> <li><strong>Bad</strong>: what went poorly (i.e., process, cascading failures, etc&hellip;).</li> <li><strong>Lessons</strong>: what was learned (i.e., flaws in the process, missing monitoring, etc&hellip;).</li> <li><strong>Action Items</strong>: assigned items to be completed in a timely fashion related to the disruption.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Supporting Documentation</strong>: additional information (i.e., Slack Logs, Bug Reports, Screenshots, etc&hellip;).</li> </ul> <h2>Where to Track?</h2> <p>To be honest, the none of this matters matter if you aren&rsquo;t tracking disruptions to any capacity, just do it! Even if you have all your disruptions in a single text file, it&rsquo;s better than nothing. Let&rsquo;s get realistic though, we can do much better. For starters, you could opt for a spreadsheet or a basic database, maybe even a heavier integrated service like <a href="https://victorops.com/">VictorOps</a>.</p> <p>At theScore, we use a GitHub repository where each <em>issue</em> is a disruption report. We record the aforementioned data points in each issue&rsquo;s description. We decided to use GitHub as it:</p> <ul> <li>Has great markdown support to provide rich information (i.e., font-styles, links, images, tables).</li> <li>Gives us closer integration with our code if we want to link to resources in other repositories.</li> <li>Has built-in support for comments on an issue to better facilitate discussions.</li> <li>Has labels and open/close states for issues, which layers in additional categorization and grouping.</li> <li>Has an API to interface with (for automation and analysis).</li> </ul> <p>For us, our action items become <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-task-lists/">GitHub tasks</a> with a mentioned individual or team. Issues are to be closed when all action items are resolved, and after sufficient discussion/retrospection has been carried out.</p> <h2>How to Track?</h2> <p>After a disruption, within a few days, it should be tracked. Waiting too long to track a disruption will result in fuzzy/shallow details. There much special in building up the report, although from personal experience it is good for people to jot notes down immediately after a disruption. I also find it effective to create a specific channel or chatroom in your team&rsquo;s messaging application when dealing with disruptions as all the communication is located in one area.</p> <p>PagerDuty has some fantastic material on a <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/after/post_mortem_process/">post-mortem process</a> and even a <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/after/post_mortem_template/">post-mortem template</a>. They also document <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/before/different_roles/">defined roles during a disruption</a>, in which the <em>Scribe</em> is a critical role for tracking purposes.</p> <p>A disruption report can be a single person&rsquo;s responsibility, although it usually helps to reach out to the people involved for clarifying details.</p> <h1>Making Sense of the Data</h1> <p>With all these disruptions tracked, what can we do with them? Hopefully, all the action items and retrospection have led to large gains. Additionally, there is a lot of value in the data itself, it is simply a matter of finding the signals you want to pay attention too. For example:</p> <ul> <li>The frequency of disruptions (per service). <ul> <li>What services to focus on improving resilience.</li> </ul></li> <li>Distribution of when disruptions happen. <ul> <li>When to be prepared (i.e., weekend/evenings) for possible on-call resolution.</li> </ul></li> <li>Time to detection over time. <ul> <li>Are the improvements being made to monitoring helping out?</li> </ul></li> <li>etc&hellip;</li> </ul> <p>Find aspects that your organization cares about and measure them.</p> <h1>Improving the Process</h1> <p>Never stop and periodically revisit the process to make adjustments. What works for one team, might not work for others. Even though tracking a disruption can be seen as <em>additional</em> work, it will pay itself off in time.</p> <div class=article__comments-button><button type=button class="btn btn-default show-comments">Click to Disqus</button></div> <div id=disqus_thread></div> </div> </div> </div> <script>
